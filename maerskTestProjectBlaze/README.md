In order to run this, it is required to have latest version of IntelliJ
as well as latest verison of Google Chrome along with the same version
of the chrome driver. It is also neccesary to change the chromedriver path

A test of a flight booking system, finding the critical path to be
selecting a city to flight from and to flight to. Next selecting
a flight from the available ones, and filling in the details of the
customer booking the flight. This can be found in the homepage test
in a method called ShouldBookFlightFromParisToLondon as well as using the gherkin syntax representing BDD however due to time constarints this was unable to finish it all off in the desired way.. Except from this
other simple tests have been carried out in order to make sure individual 
asspects of each page functions as intended as well as tests that 
suppose fail on purpose. Most of the functionality works as intended,
however some things do not, a good example is inputing the card number in 
the details page as letters which is allowed by the website. Due to time
constraints some tests that I would intend to do were unavailable to
complete,which is supported by the fact that exhaustive testing is not possible
one being the register page, however as it was not neccesary 
to log in to book a flight and the form is similar to details form it was not
prioritised.
